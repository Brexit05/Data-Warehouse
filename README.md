# Data-Warehouse
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a simulation of a modern data warehouse pipeline built using SQL. It demonstrates the ETL process of transforming raw data (bronze layer) into clean, structured data (silver layer) and finally preparing aggregated data for analytics (gold layer). The pipeline supports efficient querying and reporting for business intelligence use cases.

ðŸ§± Project Architecture
Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from multiple sources (e.g., customers, products, sales).

Silver Layer: Cleaned, deduplicated, and joined datasets.

Gold Layer: Aggregated business-level KPIs for reporting and analysis.
